Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
  - cloud based block storage system provided by AWS which is used for storing presistent data 
  - command: $ df -h (shows the free disk size in human understandable format)
  
Process:
   - create volume from the volume tab in AWS
   - Initial volume is in RAW format. So, first it is attached to the instance and formatted into the redhat readable format. 

Command for EBS:
   - $ lsblk    (this command shows the list of block in the VM, where we can see xvdf disk format which should be connected into xvda format)
   - $ sudo file -s /dev/xvdf ( this command shows what format is the volume)
   - $ sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf   ( xfs for aws instances )
   - $ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf  ( ext4 for rhel instances )
   - $ mount dev/xvdf /path/where/volume/needed/to/mounted
   
   Note: EBS volume is not permanently mount. To mount permanently, [ /etc/fstab ] file should be edited. 
   - to identify the UUID, command  - $ blkid
   - EBS volume cannot be mounted in more than one VM so to overcome this issue EFS can be used.


Elastic File System (EFS)
   - EFS can be mounted in more than one machine not like EBS.
   - EFS follows NFS protocol, it used network to store the data also known as Network Attached Storage (NAS). Also NFS port should be opened in security group.

Process:
   - search EFS service in AWS
   - select the VPC and zome user wants to create EFS
   - After creating mount the file system to the VM.
   
Permanently mount EFS:
   - command
        - $ [fs-xxxxx].efs.[region].amazonaws.com:/ /path/where/user/want/to/mount    nfs4 defaults,_netdev 0 0
